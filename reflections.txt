Your response goes here!

 * What new skills have you learned?

I have learned new HTML elements that I either wasn't familiar with or got confused with. Going over everything again in order to help complete this project, has made it easier to stay fresh in my memory. 

 * What has been easy?

I learned HTML a few years back and some things were fresh in my memory and some weren't. For the most part, I could remember different forms of syntax to help me complete this project. However, using the W3 Schools website (https://www.w3schools.com/) if I forgot or got confused with different methods of HTML, made the process quicker to complete and helped refreshed my memory. 

 * What has been difficult?

The most difficult thing for me was to separate HTML and Swift languages with certain areas. After learning and mastering Swift language recently, it still is fresh in my brain. I had to think differently on my approaches with HTML syntax verses Swift syntax. My brain was programmed to think in Swift for so long, that I had to take a beat in order to realize I was working with HTML.

 * How have you used problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Personally, practicing code repeatedly has helped me improve my HTML skills, as well as my time management skills. Especially, since I haven't really touched it in a few years. As I repeat things over and over, it helps me become quicker with completing projects and keeps it fresh in my mind.
